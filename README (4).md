## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts residential house prices based on features like living area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, floors, house age, and location (latitude/longitude). It covers the full ML workflow — data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment as an interactive web app.

**Objective:** Predict house prices using regression techniques.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Deployment with Streamlit

## 🧹 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled duplicate records and invalid entries (e.g. unrealistic bedroom counts)
   - Outlier treatment using the IQR method on `sqft_lot`
   - Parsed and engineered date-based features

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - `house_age` — derived from sale year and year built
   - `was_renovated` — binary flag from `yr_renovated`
   - `total_rooms`, `living_lot_ratio`, `has_basement`
   - Location represented via `lat`/`long` (found to carry far more predictive signal than one-hot encoded `zipcode` — see Future Improvements)

3. **Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression** (baseline)
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Hyperparameter tuning on Random Forest via `GridSearchCV` / `RandomizedSearchCV`
   - Target variable (`price`) log-transformed (`log1p`) to reduce skew; predictions inverse-transformed (`expm1`) for evaluation

4. **Evaluation**
   Full metrics table and comparison charts are in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

5. **Deployment**
   - Interactive **Streamlit** web app (`housepred_app.py`)
   - Users input key features (bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, floors, house age, latitude, longitude)
   - Real-time price prediction with a live map of the selected location
   - Interactive Plotly visualizations showing how each factor affects price
   - Feature importance chart

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add Gradient Boosting / XGBoost for comparison against Random Forest
- Add a FastAPI backend to separate the model-serving layer from the UI
- Expand hyperparameter search space and cross-validation folds
- Let users pick a named neighborhood (mapped internally to lat/long) instead of typing raw coordinates, for a friendlier UI
